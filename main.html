                        The Study of Buddhism is arguably just as important as its practice. 
                        Buddhism has an extensive written and oral history stretching back 
                        millenia. This website seeks to give a general overview of its history, 
                        philosphy, and practice.

                        I provide a brief introduction to the broad concepts of Buddhism: it's 
                        history including the story of the Buddha, the two foundational philosophical
                        concepts of the Four Noble Truths and The Noble Eightfold Path, and finally 
                        the basic meditation practices.

                        I am by no means an expert in teaching Buddhist concepts, nor do I identify as
                        a regularly practicing Buddhist. However, I am currently enrolled in an 
                        <cite>Introduction to the Study of Buddhism</cite> course at my four-year university.
                        I will be drawing from the concepts I have learned and providing my own interpretations
                        of certain concepts. I have provided additional resources such as a link to my 
                        Buddhism professor, Jacob Dalton, a Khyentse Foundation Distinguished University Professor 
                        in Tibetan Buddhism.
