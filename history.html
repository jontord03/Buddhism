        The story of the Buddha is just one part of the history of Buddhism as a whole.
        It is important to understand the origin of the religion and the groundwork set in
        place by the various living traditions set in place prior the life of Siddhartha Gautama.
        Additionally, Buddhism went through a period of schisms and discussions where philosophy 
        rules clashed and meshed in a web of organization.">

                        Buddhism originated in Northwest India out of the Upanisadic, Vedic, Hinduist
                        cultural landscape present in the region. The Indus Valley Civilization 
                        was the birthplace of these traditions and reached its peak in the second
                        millenia BCE.

                        The Indo-Aryan people immigrated to Northwest India from present-day Iran 
                        and gradually mixed their culture and ritual traditions. Over the years, 
                        various art, music, and religion spread throughout India, setting the groundwork for 
                        Hinduism.

                        Before he was enlightened, the Buddha was born as <cite>Siddartha Gautama</cite>. According
                        to the accepted belief, his mother gave birth standing up, and he walked out proclaiming that
                        he would achieve liberation from <cite>Samsara</cite>, the cycle of suffering.

                        could refer to the <cite>Wheel of Dharma</cite> or the wheels of the war chariot of a great

                        Siddartha lived a life of luxury and pleasure, but he wanted to see the outside world. On a city 
                        tour, he saw a sick man, a dying man, a dead man, and finally a Shramana. After reflecting 
                        on his sheltered situation, Siddartha left and became a Shramana.
