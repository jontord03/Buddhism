        Buddhist Philosophy varies between different schools of thought and movements, 
        but many Buddhist know the central concepts of the Four Noble Truths and the 
        Noble Eightfold Path. Not all Buddhists agree on the significance of each however
        and their meanings are dissected and analyzed to different levels of complexity 
        depending on one's philosophical preference or indoctrination.">

                        The Four Noble Truths are as follows: there is <i>Suffering</i> that exists in the world, 
                        there is a <strong>cause</strong> of <i>Suffering</i>, there is the <i>Cessation of Suffering</i>
                        that exists in the world (Nirvana), and there is the <strong>path</strong> to the <i>Cessation of Suffering</i>. 
                        Suffering can exist in three forms: physical pain or discomfort, the suffering of feeling change, 
                        and the suffering of the inner fear of impermanence (the Suffering of Conditions). This meaning of the 
                        last form of suffering is more subtle: according to Buddhist philosophy, <i>everything</i> is 
                        impermanent, including our <i>inner self</i>, a concept usually thought to be eternal by Hindus, and 
                        we need to accept this impermanence on a subconcious level to truly conquer suffering and achieve
                        Nirvana. Additionally, the three causes to suffering are Desire, Aversion, and Ignorance.

                        The Noble Eightfold Path to Enlightenment is the conventional path to the <i>Cessation of Suffering</i>. 
                        It consists of the following: right view, intention, conduct, action, livelihood, effort, concentration, 
                        and mindfulness. However, different schools of Buddhist thought disagree on the true path to enlightenment. 
                        For example, to those who subscribe to the <i>Mahayana</i> movement of Buddhism believe that one must first postpone 
                        their personal Nirvana and take the <i>Bodhisattva Vow</i>, promising to be reborn in a multitude of universes
                        until all beings are liberated from Samsara. Bodhisattvas are ultimately born in a <i>Buddhafield</i>, a parallel
                        universe where the conditions are optimal to reach Nirvana and become a Buddha. Some scholars argue that 
                        our current universe was Siddartha's Buddhafield.
