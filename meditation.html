                        Meditation, in it of itself, is not exclusively Buddhist. However, there are
                        many different Buddhist ways to practice meditation, such as Shamatha (Calm Abiding)
                        meditation or Vipashyana (Insight) meditation.

                <h2>Shamatha (Calm Abiding)</h2>
                <div class="shamatha">
                    <p1>
                        This is the form of meditation that most non-Buddhist's imagine when they think of Buddhist 
                        practice. 
                        When one practices Shamatha meditation, they seek to calm and quiet their mind. This can 
                        take the form of focusing on specific objects such as: love for hateful people, colors, 
                        causation for pride, or one's breath. Additionally, one can manifest the <i>Four Immeasurables</i>
                        or the <i>Four Abodes of Brahma</i> such as: lovingkindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity. 
                    </p1>

                <h2>Vipashyana (Insight)</h2>
                <div class="vipashana">
                    <p1>
                        The goal of Vipashyana is to realize <i>no self</i>, the idea that all people
                        have great difficulty realizing. According to Buddha, it is not a question of whether or 
                        no the self <i>exists</i>, but rather the fact that our idea of <i>self</i> is <strong>empty</strong>
                        and groundless. The three main objects of concentration are the 12 Links of Dependent Arising, the 
                        5 Skandas, and Mindfulness. These are three advanced philosophical concepts that all address the fact
                        that our reality is a intricately constructed dream from which we are too stubborn to wake.
